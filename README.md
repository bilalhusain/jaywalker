Jaywalker is your socially retarded self who likes to creep into socially apt people's profile while lazily enjoying its stride. It's written in coffeescript and uses nodejs + mongodb.

* Start with a profile
* Collect name, some link information (for demo)
* Repeat for friends in circle
* Profit

*Note* It's a quick hack. A 3.14 out of 10 code by github standard.

To run:

    $MONGO_HOME/bin/mongod -dbpath .
    coffee jaywalker.coffee

Probably means $ for spammers and agenda for privacy experts. Okay :(
